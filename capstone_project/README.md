# capstone project - fx spot prediction

Unusual libraries used are:
- Keras, subprocess, sklearn, IPython, pypyodbc and seaborn

To navigate the book, the jupyter extension plugin TOC should be used, as it enables a table of contents widget to make navigation of such a long document easier.

The notebook contains a switch to activate a classification implementation, but this is not contained in the project report as it is out of scope.

There are a number of experimental implementations, such as Ridge Regression and a scaled prediction check, but these can be disregarded. They are out of scope for the report.
